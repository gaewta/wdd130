                <p>My name is Rio Omine. I am passionate about flower arrangement, and also studying programming in a class at school and creating a website in that class.
                Although I have not yet decided what I want to do in the future, 
                I would like to work in a field where I can continue to research something that interests me and use what I am good at. 
                I have been interested in programming for several years, and I am grateful and excited to have the opportunity to learn it in earnest!
                I also love Thailand, having studied there when I was 15 years old through the Rotary Youth Exchange Program! 
                I am currently working in a Thai restaurant to earn money for college while also studying Thai.</p>
